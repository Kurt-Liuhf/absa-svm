externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the ## has a terrible glare .

the fact that the ## reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or donot want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .
