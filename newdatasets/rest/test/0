we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the ## -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .

service was awful - mostly because ## were overwhelmed on a saturday night .

the ## is 100 italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .

would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20 - 30 minutes , the ## tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?
manager

not only is the food authentic , but the ## here are practically off - the - boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .

good cake but : it was not the best cake ihave ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked ## .

the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud - mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the ## ) getting loaded for an ac / dc concert or a knicks game .
