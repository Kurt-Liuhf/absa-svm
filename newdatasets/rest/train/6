i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 ## for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
