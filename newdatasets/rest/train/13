i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting ## , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

so , the ## is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .

i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the ## .
