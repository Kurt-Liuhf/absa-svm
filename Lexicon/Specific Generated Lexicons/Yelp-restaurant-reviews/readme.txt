DATA SOURCE
**********************************************

The NRC Yelp Restaurant Sentiment Lexicons are automatically generated from the following data source:
customer reviews for food-related businesses from the Yelp Phoenix Academic Dataset (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).


**********************************************
FILE FORMAT
**********************************************

Each line in the lexicons has the following format:
<term><tab><score><tab><Npos><tab><Nneg>

<term> can be a unigram or a bigram;
<score> is a real-valued sentiment score: score = PMI(w, pos) - PMI(w, neg), where PMI stands for Point-wise Mutual Information between a term w and the positive/negative class;
<Npos> is the number of times the term appears in the positive class, ie. in tweets with positive hashtag or emoticon;
<Nneg> is the number of times the term appears in the negative class, ie. in tweets with negative hashtag or emoticon.


**********************************************
AffLex and NegLex
**********************************************

Both parts, AffLex and NegLex, of each lexicon are contained in the same file. The NegLex entries have suffixes '_NEG' or '_NEGFIRST'.

In the unigram lexicon:
'_NEGFIRST' is attached to terms that directly follow a negator;
'_NEG' is attached to all other terms in negated contexts (not directly following a negator).

In the bigram lexicon:
'_NEG' is attached to all terms in negated contexts.

Both suffixes are attached only to nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. All other parts of speech do not get these suffixes attached.
