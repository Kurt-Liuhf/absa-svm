Negative Restuarant reviews about Service

1. the environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.

2. from the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.

3. service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique - seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.

4. the price is reasonable although the service is poor.

5. other than the crappy service from two individuals, it is great.

6. icky crappy service.

7. a bit of a wait for the food, but it was worth it! the service is amazing and gabriella is an excellent manager who really knows how to treat her customers well.

8. classy environment with great service from our waiter - very good experience..the food is of top quality..one of the best food in vancouver.

9. excellent service - always remembered who we are, great waiters! great food every time!! good place for business meetings too.

10. i was hoping to get away from hectic life of yaletown lower mainland and experience some middle eastern food. while the service was good, i'm afraid it just wasn't there for me on the food front.

11. great service and excellent food..the best mediterranean restaurant in vancouver..it is a little pricey but once you try it you will understand why! highly recommended.

12. gabriella was a wonderful hostess and the service was good, but it definitely didn't make up for the blandness of the food..we will not be going back there again.

13. ew...i don't know how this place makes money if they couldn't pay for good service.

14. when we arrived at the restuarant, we were not greeted and seated right away..i do appreciate the fact that they had a full house but it took quite some time before someone came to take our order...the food was ok...not great - but i would
